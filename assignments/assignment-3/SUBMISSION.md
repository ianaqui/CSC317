# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
This assignment challenged me to create four different CSS approaches for the same portfolio HTML. In this assignment I created a hand-written CSS file, 2 CSS files done by AI, and 1 hybrid solution combining all into one CSS file. 

For my hand-written CSS, I made a simple and minimal CSS file that uses things that I have learned in lectures. I was able to implement responsive design, flexbox, and spacing. 

For my first theme, I chose F1 McLaren. For this, I used Claude 3.7's deep reasoning model and used a prompt asking it to make a CSS file based on it. The AI then generated a CSS file that and a clean and minimal look with hovering effects while keeping the color scheme the same for McLaren's orange and blue colors.For my second theme, I chose F1 Red Bull. For this, I also used Claude 3.7 deep reasoning model but this time used an image of RedBull's F1 car on the track at night. The AI was able to generate a CSS file that looked completely different than what the F1 McLaren themed one looked like. This version had more animation effects when hovering over things and gradient coloring. Using AI for the CSS file was quick and easy to use and be more creative with how my portfolio website could look like.

For my hybrid solution, I combined elements from all files. Most of the animations and styling, I took inspiration from the F1 Red Bull themed CSS. I decided to go with different colors and tried doing a F1 Mercedes Petronas themed one and used gradient background colors just like how it was in the Red Bull CSS.


## Lessons Learned
From this project, I learned about different ways CSS can be used to style a website. I learned how AI can help me with creative ideas that I would not be able to come up with of how I want my website to look like. I learned how simple animations on hover effects can make the website look and feel better.

## Preferred Version
I prefer the hybrid solution the best because it combines the structure of my hand-written CSS with the creative styling and animations done from the AI versions. I like the aesthetic and how simple and clean the website looks while keeping a racing theme with the hover effects.
