## Implementation Overview
I made a calculator that looks like the iOS calculator. It does basic math (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and has extra features like percentages, sign changing, and decimals. It has a dark background with orange operation buttons just like iOS. Users can click buttons or use their keyboard to enter numbers and operations. The calculator handles errors like division by zero and shows big numbers in scientific format. I added the calculator to my portfolio with a description and link. There's a back button to return to the portfolio. I also created a theme switcher with four designs that saves your choice when you return later.

## Challenges and Solutions
The main challenge was tracking calculator math operations in order. I fixed this by using variables to keep track of numbers and operations. I also had to handle errors like division by zero.

## Additional Features
- Theme Switcher: Four different looks for the calculator

## Resources Used
- iOS Calculator app for design ideas
