## Implementation
I created a calculator that looks like the iOS Calculator app. I created it to have the same basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. I also added functions such as converting to percentages, sign toggle, support for decimals. I also added a feature to deal with errors, such as dividing by zero and the calculator will display "Error". I added a feature for keyboard input, so that the calculator will work with both keyboard and mouse button clicks. I created my CSS file to be themed like the iOS Calculator app. I chose the same colors and design.

## Challenges
The hardest challenge when creating this assingment was tracking math operations in the correct order. The way I fixed this is by using variables to keep track of numbers and operations. 

## Additional Features
Theme Switcher:
Allows you to switch with the iOS Calculator style, and 3 other themes similar to my portfolio's 4 themes. 
Ai Theme 1 is themed after McLaren.
Ai Theme 2 is themed after Redbull Racing.
Ai Theme 3 is themed after Mercedes Petronas.

## Resources Used
