## Group Project: Recipe Sharing Platform

For this final project, I integrated our group project (Assignment 5: Recipe Sharing Platform) into my personal portfolio website. Our group created a recipe sharing web application called "PantryPal" that lets users create, share, and discover recipes.

Key features:
- User authentication system (registration, login, profile management)
- Create, edit, view, and delete recipes 
- Filter recipes by cost, time, and dietary restrictions
- Search functionality for finding recipes
- Recipe image uploads
- Integration with TheMealDB API for additional recipe content

## My Contributions

I worked on the database implementation for our group project, these were my main responsibilities.
### Backend - Database Implementation
* **Backend Features:**
  * Configure MongoDB database connection
  * Create Recipe model with all required fields and validation
  * Implement data persistence for recipes and user data
  * Develop database queries for cost and time filtering
  * Design database schema for recipe-user relationships

## Technical Challenges

One challenge I had was integrating TheMealDB API to work with MongoDB because of how they store data differently. I solved this by creating a function that handles both data sources.

## What I Learned

From this project, I learned:
- MongoDB schema design and validation
- Database performance optimization with indexes
- API integration strategies
- Collaborative development with Git
- Full-stack web application architecture

## Resources Used
- MongoDB with Mongoose - For database schema design and queries
- JavaScript - For implementation logic
- TheMealDB API documentation - For API integration
